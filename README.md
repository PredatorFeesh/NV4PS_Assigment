# How to run
This is run using NodeJS. Modules are in `package-lock.json`. They can be installed using `npm ci`. If this doesn't work, you will need to install is `express`, `mongodb`, and `body-parser`.

In order for me not to give out the address I was given, please be sure to replace the uri variable, currently holding the value `<INPUT HERE BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM>` with the correct student MongoDB Atlas URL.

This runs using Mongo, and should work given the link I was provided.
